## Classification - Data
In this classification problem we will be classifying mobile phone price bands based on other features of the phones.
Multiple different models have been used to predict which of the four classes the phone belongs to:
- [Artificial Neural Network](ANN)
- [Decision Tree](Decision_Tree)
- [Random Forest](Random_Forest)
- [K Nearest Neighbours](KNN)
- [Naive Bayes](Naive_Bayes)
- [Support Vector Machine](SVM)
- [Gradient Boosting](XGBoost)
