## Classification - Data
In this classification problem we will be classifying credit card transactions as fraudulent or not fraudulent. However, in this problem, the majority of transactions are not fraudulent so we have to know how to work with imbalanced datasets.\
\
For this problem we will be using an artificial neural network.\
\
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) has been removed due to its size.
